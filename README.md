### 9th July 2025
**Milestone: Flask Login Integration and Security, Milestone: Charts and Visualization**  
Integrate Flask-Login and Restrict routes and protect sessions.  
This was done by using flask-login package.  
Logins were managed by LoginManager, it redirects to userlogin by default if not logged in with decorator(login_manager which implemets a method of usermixin).  
And added password storage hashing using werkzeug.security, by adding methods to the user db logic(set and check password implementing generate and check password hash respectively).  
Charts and Visualizations were previously unknowingly completed while completing milestone5&6.

**Milestone: Frontend and Backend Validation**
Added form validation using HTML5 and also with the help of JS in user registration.  
With the help of JS made toggle button to see the password.  
Form validation both frontend and backend were done using RE[Regular Expressions], RE's were taken from popular websites by quick google search, easier RE's were formulated by myself such as name restrictions.  
User re library for matching on backend side.
